## Task 2
Using the conditional formatting tools, the following explorations was requested with the data:

  - Highlight any cells with formula errors in purple with white text.
  - Highlight any cells with missing values in yellow.
  - Identify accounts that have not been cross-sold with Product 2 by highlighting the appropriate Product 2 cells in orange.
  - Identify accounts that have a 5-year sales CAGR of at least 100% by highlighting the appropriate CAGR cells in green and any accounts with a negative CAGR in red with white text.
  - Identify accounts in the top 10% of unit sales for 2021 by highlighting the appropriate 2021 unit sales cells in blue.




## Task 3
With the same dataset, it  was used to create two macros and associated buttons:

  - A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 5 YR CAGR in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall 5-year sales growth.
  - A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 2021 unit sales in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall unit sales in 2021.

## Task 4
Using Pivot Table and Chart:
By leveraging Excel tools like pivot tables and formatted tables, the sales data was transformed and organized to create an interactive dashboard that visually tracks key metrics. 
This data visualization enables users to easily analyze and interpret trends in the sales figures. The insights from the dashboard can then inform data-driven business decisions regarding marketing strategies, inventory planning, sales projections and more.

## Task 5
Using Microsoft Powerpoint:
    Prepared my presentation using the template provided in Additional Resources to communicate key points and ideas about my account sales analysis, including sales performance (or lack thereof), opportunities for improvement or operational focus, and any other points you think tell a good data-driven story.
    
## Recommendation
 My recommendation based on the result of this analysis includes:
1. I would recommend investing more in social media campaigns, especially for the online retail businesses.
2. I would suggest focusing more marketing budget on tailored print collateral for the wholesale distribution vertical specifically.

The data indicates marketing channels like social media and print/catalogs can have significant impact on sales, but tactics should be tailored based on business type. An omnichannel approach pairing digital and traditional marketing is likely optimal, with customization for each customer vertical.
    
## Limitation
Limitations of the data include lack of cost information and limited sample sizes within each segment. The end deliverable will be a presentation of findings to advise the sales and marketing teams on tactics tailored to different business types and customer cohorts.

## Conclusion
The growing online and broadening product lines while leveraging marketing tactics and customer insights are key opportunities highlighted by the data to drive higher sales performance. A targeted, data-driven approach is recommended versus any one-size-fits-all solution.
